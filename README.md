# face-attendance-recognition-system

This web App contains both Frontend and backend. The Front end was
developed by HTML and CSS. The backend contains firebase and django. The idea
of the project is to detect the face of the user and mark the attendance which
gets stored on the Firebase and then an excel sheet of attendance is created
which is the final input. The additional backend for face recognition was
implemented on the pycharm platform using open-cv python.
